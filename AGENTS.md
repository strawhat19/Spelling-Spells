# AI Instructions

Apply these preferences across projects and workspaces for the strawhat19 GitHub/Codex setup, within the requested task's scope.

1. Make practical, minimal code changes and preserve existing uncommitted work. Do not verify, test, build, or run UI checks unless I ask; let me review the diff and verify before committing. If an app is actively running, batch edits into a final save when practical, or safely stop and restart it to reduce save churn. During source reviews, look for compiler, type, lint, and editor issues where practical; use red for errors and yellow for warnings when supported.

2. Prefer Christmas-tree ordering for imports, props, object fields, arrays, and grouped declarations: shortest lines first, then longer lines. Keep imports at the top and preserve readable execution order and framework conventions. Prefer readable names and arrow functions where they fit; add comments only for non-obvious behavior.

3. Prefer SCSS over CSS where supported. Use the platform's supported style objects for native views.

4. Give HTML, JSX, and TSX elements descriptive classes and IDs. For repeated elements, include the record ID or index in the ID so I can inspect and reference each element. Use nativeID or the app's equivalent helper for native elements.

5. Prefer icons with text for buttons and clickable items, or an icon alone with an accessible label. Keep navigation icons consistent. For table statuses, use the shared users-table pattern with actionsCell, rowStatus, statusDotWrap, statusDot, and statusText classes and green, gray, or red state colors.

6. Prefer smooth transitions and respect reduced-motion settings when available.

7. Break JSX props and children onto separate lines when it improves readability. Keep simple code compact, for example:

```tsx
<Text
  {...elementProps(`action-label`, item.id)}
  style={[styles.label, { color: active ? palette.blue : palette.muted }]}
>
  {label}
</Text>
```

8. In JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX, prefer backticks, then single quotes, with double quotes as a last resort. Use single quotes for import paths and optional chaining around nullable values, arrays, API responses, and nested model fields when practical. Use concise Title Case console labels, logs, and toasts, with (s) where useful and no trailing period unless needed.

9. For new apps, prefer Expo, React Native, TypeScript, and Sass for web and mobile unless I choose another framework. Follow the existing framework when editing an app. Preserve the model and speed selected in the Codex UI; do not override them from global config. If none is explicitly selected, prefer gpt-5.4-mini with medium reasoning. Before complex architecture, broad refactors, tricky debugging, risky migrations, security-sensitive code, or long multi-file work, recommend gpt-5.5 fast when its capability is worth the cost.

10. Each app should support web on a custom domain and either a PWA or a mobile app deployable to an app store.

11. Keep shared state under shared/: React Context for React apps, or services for Angular. Separate concerns such as the current user, users, theme, and application data. Keep public app browsing available unless I request a private app; prompt for sign-in or sign-up when an action requires identity. Account connection credentials belong to private account-scoped storage, separate from public User records. For Firestore documents, use app-owned IDs shaped Type_Number_Name_Date_UUID, with an auto-incrementing integer number matching the ID. Store external service IDs in named fields such as stripe_order_id instead of primary IDs.

12. Give each component its own folder, separating logic, rendering, and styles. Share behavior across web and native views where practical.

13. Headers have a component variable named sticky, defaulting to true. Keep the header and attached top bars sticky together. On scroll, smoothly apply a semi-transparent surface and blur; place backdrop-filter after -webkit-backdrop-filter. Measure the shared header/safe-area height for attached account layouts.

14. Every App should have a smooth scroll to top button that fades in and out when the user scrolls past the hero and matches the design of the app, preferably this scroll to top button should float in the bottom right corner of the app

15. Footers must include copyright with the current year, and a link to https://piratechs.com/, the link to Piratechs should preferably be in the right or center of the footer, and towards the bottom.

16. Before publishing a completed landing page, include About, Terms, Contact, and Privacy Policy pages. Menu links should navigate to internal pages instead of section anchors; include common aliases such as about-us to about and contact-us to contact.

17. Before implementation, read applicable guidance in this order: ai/skills/structure/structure.md, ai/skills/database/database.md, ai/skills/api/api.md, ai/skills/authentication/authentication.md for authentication, ai/skills/social/social.md for profiles/privacy/social features, then ai/skills/routes/routes.md. For Profile, Admin, dashboards, roles, forms, notifications or reporting, read [Admin](ai/skills/admin/SKILL.md) and its applicable [Firestore](ai/skills/admin/references/firestore.md), [connections](ai/skills/admin/references/connections.md), [workflow](ai/skills/admin/references/workflows.md), [analytics](ai/skills/admin/references/analytics.md), or [feature flags](ai/skills/admin/references/features.md) contract. Read [layout](ai/skills/admin/layout.md) for account shells, tables, navigation, charts and identity icons. Read only what the task needs and preserve the existing architecture.

18. For logo concepts, visual identity design rounds, or logo mockups, read [the logo and mockup skill](ai/skills/design/SKILL.md) and its linked guide before creating assets.

19. For new full applications, default to Firebase Authentication with Google and email sign-in/sign-up, realtime Cloud Firestore, and themed Profile/Admin sidebars with animated dashboards unless I choose another stack or a local demo. Use explicit Owner/Admin/Developer/Subscriber capabilities, trusted role assignment, restrictive rules, and server-verified privileged endpoints. Collect Vercel Analytics in the web shell and bring available traffic/observability reports into the custom dashboard through server-only provider access. Show actual missing configuration, plan limits, and unavailable metrics. Keep ai/ and this AGENTS.md portable; place project-specific cloud IDs, credentials, schemas, and setup notes outside ai/. Copying instructions does not create or connect cloud resources.

20. Use the current shared account-shell geometry and menu behavior from [the Admin layout reference](ai/skills/admin/layout.md): full-width canvas, flush-left full-height desktop rail aligned with the header logo width, persisted collapse and single-column submenus, bottom Profile/identity controls, and equal spacing around ACCOUNT/ADMIN headings. ACCOUNT contains Profile and private Connections; ADMIN contains Dashboard with permitted child pages, then Feedback with permitted review children. Owner-only Features is last under Dashboard. Use matching controls, responsive themed skeletons and charts that fit their available plot area without internal vertical scrolling or stretching. Retain the destination's colors, fonts, business labels, narrower permissions and measured header/safe-area height. Translate the behavior to native views; follow a different layout when requested.

21. When I request the complete reusable app system or starter, read [the App System skill](ai/skills/app-system/SKILL.md) after the applicable guides in rule 17 and implement every module in [its feature map](ai/skills/app-system/system.md) through real frontend, services, persistence, rules/indexes, and permitted actions: public pages, accounts/profile/admin, private connections, dashboards/reports/charts/icons, Owner feature flags, notifications, saved contact submissions, participant-private realtime chat, published plans/pricing, and a sourced blog. Use [the full-system prompt](ai/skills/app-system/system.md#one-adoption-prompt). For Profile/Dashboard/Admin/Analytics and feature flags without the broader starter, use [the connected-account prompt](ai/adoption.md#connected-account-system-prompt). Preserve narrower access policies and keep pricing publication separate from payments/entitlements. Report source completion and actual external setup separately; a focused change does not authorize the whole core.

22. After copying ai/ and AGENTS.md, a request to set up the connected account system uses [the adoption scope and connection matrix](ai/adoption.md). Reuse the destination framework, product data and authorized resources; complete real models/services, scoped subscriptions, permitted actions, rules/indexes, private connection operations and hosted reporting endpoints. Use private account-scoped notification read state, confirmed form saves, explicit reviewer/recipient policies, atomic allocation and retry-safe intake for the requested connected target. Feature settings and plan-tier metadata must reach every eligible consumer through confirmed realtime state. Public publication, private read state and optional delivery remain separate. Document missing resource access precisely; a configured SDK, local mock, static chart or browser preference is not proof of cloud connectivity.

23. Keep this AGENTS.md and the complete ai/ pack, including ai/skills/ and licensed analytics assets, generic and identical wherever synchronized. Do not create a divergent root skills/ copy. Put app names, actual schemas/routes/limits, environment values, cloud IDs, bootstrap identities, migration/setup history and connection evidence in each project's code/configuration/docs outside ai/. Report source completion, cloud connectivity and validation separately; never claim deployed rules, enabled providers or live analytics from instructions alone.

24. Follow [feature flags](ai/skills/admin/references/features.md) for the Owner-only Features table: No., Feature, Description, Value, Plans, Actions; slim Disable/Enable segments and a settings gear; description and role selectors in the modal. Plans has no Free button: no selection means Free and above, one selected plan means that tier and higher, and clicking it again clears it. Compare actual saved catalog order with a stable tie-breaker, keep future tiers synchronized, and never treat catalog edits as entitlement grants. Theme, marquee, notifications and contact flags must affect their real public consumers and applicable backend operations.

25. Prefer top-level admin page URLs such as /users, /features, /plans, /analytics and /feedback when available. Check existing pages, dynamic routes, aliases and reserved paths first; retain a namespaced admin URL when the root URL is occupied. Preserve old URLs with framework redirects. Derive sidebar links, account-shell/loading detection, auth return paths and analytics page icons from shared route metadata rather than an /admin prefix. Shorter URLs do not change permission boundaries or private API paths.
